### Datasets

**Dataset of B-mode fatty liver ultrasound images:**
 https://zenodo.org/records/1009146

**B-mode-and-CEUS-Liver | Ultrasound data of a variety of liver masses:**
Data were generated as part of two ongoing clinical trials investigating the use of **c**ontrast-**e**nhanced **u**ltra**s**ound to a) characterize indeterminate liver lesions and b) monitor treatment response to loco regional therapy. Ultrasound data was obtained on a variety of state of the art ultrasound scanners with curvilinear probes.

**US simulation & segmentation- Real and synthetic abdominal ultrasound scans, with manual segmentations:** 
real US scans and synthetic images generated with a ray-casting based simulator. Both datasets are extended with annotations of several abdominal organs, in an effort to provide tools to improve current existing methods.

**LiTS17 (Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2017):** **LiTS17** is a liver tumor segmentation benchmark. The data and segmentations are provided by various clinical sites around the world. The training data set contains 130 CT scans and the test data set 70 CT scans.
